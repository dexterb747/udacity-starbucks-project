#Libraries

The libraries used for this project are pandas and sklearn.

#Motivation

The motivation for this project is that I am a regular Starbucks customer and I wanted to utilize this dataset for this project to understand how they attract their customers to increase sales.

Project Definition:
This project uses Starbucks data from the rewards program to engage with customers on various offers Starbucks has. The motivation for this project is that I am a regular Starbucks customer and I wanted to utilize this dataset for this project to understand how they attract their customers to increase sales.

Problem Statement-
The problem selected is to determine the communication channel with the biggest impact on customers which will increase purchases hence increase sales for Starbucks.

Results:

The relevant columns were removed from the analysis and model to ensure the focus was on the communication channels used which resulted in the offer being completed.

The model was created and fitted successfully. Then the order of importance was calculated.


Conclusion:

The channel which had the biggest impact on resulting in a transaction completed is social channels. Starbucks should ensure that they continue to use and add more to this social channel to increase sales. They can continue using the other channels as well like web and mobile. They can also test email channel by removing it as a channel for some of the programs to determine the impact. I had a challenge to split the values from the channels column so I edited the json file to split it into 4 channels columns due to limited time.

There are a number of other areas which can be further analyzed if I had more time like determining impact of income, age, increasing the reward amount etc., increasing/decreasing the duration of an offer.
